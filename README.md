> A basic template for creating new repositories at @nantli organization

This repository is meant to be used as an initial kick starter for your new project, but some initial work is required to adecuated it to your new adventure. GLHF!

## Checklist

- [ ] Replace this README.md file with one of your liking. You can keep what serves you though
- [ ] Replace CHANGELOG.md file with one of your liking. We recommend following the ['Keep a Changelog'](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format, which this repo follows.
- [ ] Update licensor in LICENSE file if needed

## But also

Next you can find a list of things you need to consider when using this template

- A PR linter GitHub action ([action-semantic-pull-request](https://github.com/amannn/action-semantic-pull-request)) exists to watch that PRs follow Conventional Commits spec. This works well with SemVer and a couple other actions listed below.
- Giphy generator workflow ([giphy-generator](https://github.com/IAmHughes/giphy-generator)) will need GIPHY_TOKEN secret to be set at your repo, profile or organization level, in order to work.
- Label commenter workflow ([label-commenter](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-label-commenter)) configuration is customized to be used inside @nantli and before you can use it outside of the organization you will need to update [label-commenter-config.yml](.github/label-commenter-config.yml) to your liking.
- Release Drafter workflow ([release-drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter)) assumes the use of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.
- Multi labeler workflow ([multi-labeler](https://github.com/fuxingloh/multi-labeler)) configuration is also customized to be used inside @nantli and before you can use it outside of the organization you will need to update [labeler.yml](.github/labeler.yml) to your liking.
- Label Checker workflow ([label-checker](https://github.com/agilepathway/label-checker)) configuration is also customized to be used inside @nantli and, and it helps with following Conventional Commits spec and SemVer, before you can use it outside of the organization you will need to update [pr-workflow.yml](.github/workflow/pr-workflow.yml) to your liking, look for jobs starting with 'check\_'.

### A quick introduction to Conventional Commits format

This is how a commit looks like in Conventional Commits format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Where `<type>` if one of these: fix, feat, chore, ci, docs, etc. And fix correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning while feat correlates to MINOR in Semantic Versioning. A scope may be provided for additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., `feat(parser): add ability to ...`.

Finally, for the optional footers, BREAKING CHANGE must be used when a commit introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning).

#### Example

```
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files
```

And thats it for now, thanks for reading. Show love ü´∂üèæ to animals üêÑ üêñ ü¶É !
